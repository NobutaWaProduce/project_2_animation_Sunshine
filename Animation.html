    <h1>The light goes out</h1>
    <p>Nothing is certain in life. People love the light because it protects them from the dark and unknown, and it makes them feel warm. But they forget the light also goes out when the time comes. A candle can simply be blown out and then there shall be darkness. Yes the sun gives us light in the day that tis so bright, we fear nothing, but what about a night? They're scared to go out, because the moonlight is not that bright, but there is still some light at night that gives them hope. But what happens when the sun is covered up? Darkness comes. What happens when the dim light of the moon is covered? Darkness comes.</p>
    <h3>Tear down the cross, Splinters and shards. Remembered this Trojan horse that rode to the land we enter. We'll burn away and free our fallen brothers. From shackles made Of steel and bones of soldiers. Let shadows die So I can feel alive. A church of lies Can't tell me what is right. Our little victories and desires won't live on. Let shadows die So I can feel alive, feel alive. In fear and faith, The candles light our freedom. By tainted night we live this war of wisdom. The streets are stained, With blood that ran their kingdom And feed the beast that lies beneath our treason.</h3>
    <h2>F.E.A.R. round up these rebels. These deviants, these so-called Wild Ones, we will litter the streets with their bones And annihilate the dangerous and obtuse ideas poisoning your children, Endangering your freedom, giving rise to the destruction of the benevolent future we have prepared for you. You belong to the shadows, and the shadows are where you will remain safe. Do not disobey.</h2>

   <p>The clock stopped ticking forever ago. How long have I been up? I don't know. I can't get a grip, but I can't let go There wasn't anything to hold on to though. Why can't I see? Why can't I see? All the colors that you see? Please, can I be, Please can I be, Colorful and free? What the hell's going on?! Can someone tell me please? Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV? I'm black, then I'm white, No! Something isn't right! My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight! The trembling fear is more than I can take, When I'm up against The echo in the mirror! Echo! I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black. I'm gonna run away now and never look back. I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black. I'm gonna run away now and never look back. I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black. I'm gonna run away now and never look back. I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black. I'm gonna run away now and never look back. I'm gonna burn my house down, And never look back. And never look back. And never look back! What the hell's going on?! Can someone tell me please? Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV? I'm black, then I'm white, No! Something isn't right! My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight! What the hell's going on?! Can someone tell me please? Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV? I'm black, then I'm white, No! Something isn't right! My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight! The trembling fear is more than I can take, When I'm up against The echo in the mirror! The trembling fear is more than I can take, When I'm up against The echo in the mirror! </P>
     <h3>Tightly embracing only the empty broken shell. The pouring rain is your silent tears Wake me up Wake me up Wake me up From this dream. Real or dream? Real or dream? Real or dream? Please tell me, Maria! Smiling, I touched your cheeks and said "kill me..." Tears gathered in my blinded eyes, and then disappeared. Take me Out Take me Out Take me Out From this dream. Real or dream? Real or dream? Real or dream? Answer me, JESUS! God said when you die, Your life will pass before your own eyes. If you want to feel it right now, Just do it, do it, do it! Wake me up Wake me up Wake me up From this dream. Real or dream? Real or dream? Real or dream? Please tell me. Take me Out Take me Out Take me Out From this dream! Real or dream? Real or dream? Real or dream? Answer me, JESUS!</h3>
     <h2>I cannot spend another night in this home I close my eyes and take a breath real slow The consequence is if I leave I'm alone. But what's the difference when you beg for love? As I run through glass in the street Kerosene hearts carry the name that my father gave me And take the face of the wolf. 'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat. With heaven above you, there's hell over me. I met a girl who never looked so alone Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm. She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue. We fell in love and now we're both alone 'Cause I don't need any more friends. And another kiss like a fire on pavement We'll burn it down till the end. This is a wasteland, my only retreat With heaven above you, there's hell over me. The water is rusted, the air is unclean. And there for a second I feel free. This is a wasteland, my only retreat. I've waited all this night to honor you and say, "I know it's hard, but who are you to fall apart on me, on me?" This is a wasteland, my only retreat. With heaven above you, there's hell over me 'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat. With heaven above you, there's hell over me. You said what about us, well, what about me? Hang from the gallows asleep in the rain 'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat. Paralyze me. Don't let me jump, don't let me fall</h2>
